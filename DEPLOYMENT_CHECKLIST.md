### Environment Variables Ready
- [ ] `POSTGRES_URL` = `postgres://aromanon:Afmg2486!@my-job-scraper_my-job-scraper:5432/job-data?sslmode=disable`
- [ ] `REDIS_URL` = `redis://default:Afmg2486!@my-job-scraper_my-job-scraper_redis:6379`
- [ ] `SECRET_KEY` = Random secret string for Flask

### VPS Services Status
- [ ] PostgreSQL service `my-job-scraper_my-job-scraper` running
- [ ] Redis service `my-job-scraper_my-job-scraper_redis` running
- [ ] EasyPanel installed and accessible on VPS

## üöÄ EasyPanel Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Upload Project to VPS
- [ ] Upload all JobSpy files to VPS using EasyPanel's file manager or Git
- [ ] Place files in a dedicated directory (e.g., `/home/aromanon/job-scraper`)

### Step 2: Create Frontend Service (my-job-scraper-fe)
1. Log into EasyPanel dashboard
2. Click "Add Service" ‚Üí "Docker Compose" ‚Üí "Upload Files"
3. Select directory where files were uploaded
4. Service Name: `job-scraper-frontend`
5. Use configuration from `docker-compose.easypanel.yml` (frontend section)
6. Add Environment Variables:
   ```
   POSTGRES_URL=postgres://aromanon:Afmg2486!@my-job-scraper_my-job-scraper:5432/job-data?sslmode=disable
   REDIS_URL=redis://default:Afmg2486!@my-job-scraper_my-job-scraper_redis:6379
   SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
   FLASK_APP=worker_admin.py
   PYTHONPATH=/app:/app/jobspy
   ```
7. Click "Deploy"

### Step 3: Create Worker Service (my-job-scraper-worker)
1. Click "Add Service" ‚Üí "Docker Compose" ‚Üí "Upload Files"
2. Service Name: `job-scraper-worker`
3. Use configuration from `docker-compose.easypanel.yml` (worker section)
4. Add Environment Variables:
   ```
   POSTGRES_URL=postgres://aromanon:Afmg2486!@my-job-scraper_my-job-scraper:5432/job-data?sslmode=disable
   REDIS_URL=redis://default:Afmg2486!@my-job-scraper_my-job-scraper_redis:6379
   WORKER_ENGINE=primary
   PYTHONPATH=/app:/app/jobspy
   ```
5. Click "Deploy"

### Step 4: Verify Services
- [ ] Frontend service shows "Running" status in EasyPanel
- [ ] Worker service shows "Running" status in EasyPanel
- [ ] No error messages in service logs

## üîß Post-Deployment Setup

### Database Initialization
- [ ] Access web interface at provided URL (usually http://server-ip:5000)
- [ ] Database should auto-initialize on first access
- [ ] Verify tables created in PostgreSQL:
  - `scraping_workers`
  - `scraping_databases` 
  - `worker_execution_history`
  - `proxy_servers`

### Test Worker Configuration
- [ ] Create test worker through web interface
- [ ] Verify worker appears in dashboard
- [ ] Test worker execution manually
- [ ] Check execution history appears

### Verify Functionality
- [ ] Health check endpoint: `http://server-ip:5000/health` returns healthy
- [ ] Worker scheduling system active
- [ ] Database connections working
- [ ] Redis connections working
- [ ] Log files being created and populated

## üìä EasyPanel Features to Verify

### Built-in Monitoring
- [ ] Resource usage visible in EasyPanel dashboard
- [ ] Service health monitoring active
- [ ] Log aggregation working
- [ ] Container status monitoring

### Web Interface Access
- [ ] Admin interface accessible at deployed URL
- [ ] Can create, edit, delete workers
- [ ] Can add, test database connections
- [ ] Can view execution history and logs

### Scaling (Optional)
- [ ] Can easily add more worker instances through EasyPanel
- [ ] Load balancing automatically managed
- [ ] Service discovery working

## üêõ Troubleshooting Checklist

### Common Issues & Solutions
- **Service won't start**: Check EasyPanel logs for build errors
- **Database connection**: Verify POSTGRES_URL in environment variables
- **Worker not executing**: Check worker logs and database schema
- **Web interface not loading**: Verify frontend service logs and port assignment

### Quick Fixes
- [ ] Environment variables properly formatted (no spaces around =)
- [ ] Database credentials correct in URLs
- [ ] Service ports not conflicting (EasyPanel handles this)
- [ ] Docker build context includes all necessary files

### Getting Help
- [ ] EasyPanel built-in help documentation
- [ ] EasyPanel community forums if needed
- [ ] Check service-specific logs in EasyPanel interface

## üéØ Go-Live Checklist

### Final Verification
- [ ] At least one worker configured and running successfully
- [ ] Job data being scraped and stored in database
- [ ] Web interface responsive and functional
- [ ] Monitoring/logging working correctly
- [ ] Can schedule workers to run automatically

### Production Readiness
- [ ] SSL certificates automatically managed by EasyPanel
- [ ] Service auto-restart configured
- [ ] Resource limits set appropriately in EasyPanel
- [ ] Backup strategy considered for database

### Next Steps
- [ ] Add custom job sites as needed
- [ ] Configure proxy servers for IP rotation
- [ ] Set up monitoring alerts in EasyPanel
- [ ] Scale workers based on scraping needs
